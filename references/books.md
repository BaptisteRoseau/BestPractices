# Books

Here are a few books I have read and want to share with you:

- [Design Patterns](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Object-Oriented-Addison-Wesley-Professional-ebook/dp/B000SEIBB8): A must read, but beware it is very dense and technical.
- Robert C. Martin's [Clean Code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship-ebook/dp/B001GSTOAM/): How to write more readable, tested and maintainable code. Not every advice is good to take, but overall this will greatly improve your skills.
- Robert C. Martin's [Clean Architecture](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Architecture-Craftsmans-Software-Structure/dp/0134494164/): Can be summarized as "use an interface", but I believe it is a must read for any developper.
- [The DevOps Handbook: How to Create World-Class Agility, Reliability, & Security in Technology Organizations](https://www.amazon.com/DevOps-Handbook-World-Class-Reliability-Organizations/dp/1950508404): This books list all the DevOps best practices that helps companies create a better work environment and scale efficiently. It is not very technical (don't expect any code), I highly suggest IT manager or CEOs/CTOs to read it.
- [Atomic Habits](https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299/): How to create habits that will allow you or your company to always become better.
