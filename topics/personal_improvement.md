## Learning

Learning is absolutely crucial to get better in software engineering, especially at the pace our technologies evolve.

Here are some tips to help you learn and improve yourself.

### PIML001 - Be Curious

When someone refers to a software or tool you don't know yet, search for it on the internet:

- What is it?
- When is it used?
- Where is it used?
- What problem does it solve?
- How much is it used currently?

Read the documentation of this product.

Watch videos or read newsletters to stay up to date or to learn specific topics.

You may be surprised by how many wonderful software tools exist. You should at least have basic knowledge of each major software used in tech companies.

Knowing a lot of them is fun and also helps you understand your colleagues when talking about a specific technology.

### PIML002 - Read

A lot of people worked in software engineering before us.
They made mistakes, succeeded, and have lots of experiences. Some of them gathered this precious experience and knowledge in multiple paper sheets called "books."

You don't need a power supply to read them, and they contain a tremendous amount of knowledge, written to ease learning.

Find a topic or a tool you are interested in, buy a book on that topic, read it, and __practice__ what you have learned.

### PIML003 - Practice

When learning a new topic, the most important part is to __practice__.

After reading the documentation, reading a book, or even without any previous learning, think about a little personal project where you can apply this knowledge.

Set a time in your week to force yourself to work on it, and you will soon be able to use a new tool or a new skill very easily.
