## Execution

### PROE001 - Unplug Your Mouse And Use Keyboard Shortcuts

Using the mouse is __very__ inefficient. A decent programmer should aim to never use it and always use the keyboard shortcuts.

For any tool that you use, look for its keyboard shortcut cheat sheet.
When found, keep it at hand, unplug your mouse and try to only use keyboard to navigate.

This will be confusing and hard at the beginning but over time it can multiply your productivity more that you can imagine.

### PROE002 - Set Up Your IDE

Look for a set-up tutorial and best practices on the internet to find the best features or plugins of your IDE.

If your team uses a standard for formatting or linting, add the tools that enforce those standard to your IDE. Some may be simple warnings, others can format all your code when saving.

You should __always__ code with error checking and methods auto-completion within your IDE.
