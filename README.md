# Best Practices

My personal best practices notebook on IT development and project management.

These are the rules I follow, and some notes to avoid making the same mistakes twice. Each rule is supposed to be short.

This repository is subject to reorganization improvement over time. Pull/Merge requests are welcome, but new rules will not be accepted if I disagree.

__Warning: This project is in continuous _Work In Progress_.__

## Codes

Rules are organized using codes to ease reference to specific advice.

The codes contain a trigram for the main topic, a letter for a category and an index.

Example: `CODN001` refers to the first (`001`) advice of the Naming section (`N`) of the Code topic (`COD`).
