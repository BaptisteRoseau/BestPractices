# Best Practices

My personal best practices notebook on IT development and project management.

These are the rules I follow, along with notes to avoid repeating the same mistakes. Each rule is intended to be concise.

This repository is subject to reorganization and improvement over time. Pull/Merge requests are welcome, but new rules will not be accepted if I disagree.

## Codes

Rules are organized using codes to facilitate referencing specific advice.

The codes contain a trigram for the main topic, a letter for a category, and an index.

Example: `CODN001` refers to the first (`001`) piece of advice in the Naming section (`N`) of the Code topic (`COD`).

## Warnings

- __No rule is absolute.__ These rules are __guidelines__; it is up to the developer and their team to decide if they should
be applied or not.
- This project is a continuous _Work In Progress_.
