# Best Practices

My personal best practices notebook on IT development and project management.

These are the rules I follow, and some notes to avoid making the same mistakes twice. Each rule is supposed to be short.

There also will be a tooling and a reference list. Currently empty but I plan on writing a lot from time to time.

## Codes

Rules are organized using codes to ease reference to a specific advice.

The codes contains a trigram for the main topic, a letter for a category and an index.

Example: `CODN001` refers to the first (`001`) advice of the Naming section (`N`) of the Code topic (`COD`).
