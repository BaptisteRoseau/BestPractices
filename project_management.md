# Project Management

## Conventions

Conventions help your code being consistent.

### TODO_CODE - Build a Glossary

When a project becomes complex, some concepts or objects may be called differently by different teams.

For example, for a movie streaming company, a movie could be called:

- _A film_ by the business team
- _The raw data_ by the technical team
- _The project_ by the producer
- _The big buddies_ by the infrastructure team

You may have already live some confusion because of inconsistent naming.
This is why a company needs to build a glossary to ensure that everybody use the term _movie_ for these objects.
This improves both internal and external communications.

### TODO_CODE - Use Git

You should use a version control tool to store our source code, such as Git.
