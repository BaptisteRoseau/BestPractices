# Project Management

## Project Workflow

### TODO_CODE - Project Phases

1. Gather feedback on the most needed feature from users
1. Specify __what__ is needed by the users in details
1. Specify __how__ it can be done by the technical team
1. Specify __the interface__ (API)

## Conventions

Conventions help your code being consistent.

### TODO_CODE - Build A Glossary

When a project becomes complex, some concepts or objects may be called differently by different teams.

For example, for a movie streaming company, a movie could be called:

- _A film_ by the business team
- _The raw data_ by the technical team
- _The project_ by the producer
- _The big buddies_ by the infrastructure team

You may have already live some confusion because of inconsistent naming.
This is why a company needs to build a glossary to ensure that everybody use the term _movie_ for these objects.
This improves both internal and external communications.

## Source Management

### TODO_CODE - Use Git

You should use a version control tool to store our source code, such as Git.
